# Third-Party Places Filtering Implementation Summary

## What We Built

Created a system to filter third-party places so hotels only see places approved by Elvira (`elvira_approved = true`).

## Files Created/Modified

### New Hooks Created

1. **`src/hooks/third-party-management/thirdparty-places/useApprovedPlaces.ts`**
   - New file with hooks that filter by `elvira_approved = true`
   - Includes: `useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces()`, `useApprovedPlaceByGoogleId()`, etc.

### Modified Files

2. **`src/hooks/third-party-management/thirdparty-places/index.ts`**

   - Added exports for the new approved places hooks

3. **`src/hooks/third-party-management/index.ts`**

   - Fixed naming conflict (renamed old alias to `useHotelApprovedPlaces`)
   - Added exports for new `useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces` hooks

4. **`src/screens/hotel/third-party-management/gastronomy/Gastronomy.tsx`**

   - Changed to use `useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces("gastronomy")`

5. **`src/screens/hotel/third-party-management/tours/Tours.tsx`**

   - Implemented full table view with `useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces("tours")`

6. **`src/screens/hotel/third-party-management/wellness/Wellness.tsx`**

   - Implemented full table view with `useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces("wellness")`

7. **`database/thirdparty_places.sql`**

   - Added `elvira_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` field
   - Added indexes for performance

8. **`database/migrations/add_elvira_approved_field.sql`**
   - Migration script to add the field to existing database

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
thirdparty_places table (all Google Places data)
    ‚Üì
elvira_approved = true (Elvira approval filter)
    ‚Üì
Hotel views (Gastronomy, Tours, Wellness tabs)
```

### Query Structure

```typescript
supabase
  .from("thirdparty_places")
  .select("*")
  .eq("elvira_approved", true) // ‚Üê This is the key filter
  .eq("category", "gastronomy"); // ‚Üê Category filter
```

## Current Issue

The query is running but returning 0 records even though:

- Database has 369 total places
- 52 places are approved (`elvira_approved = true`)
- 148 gastronomy places exist

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check if the hook is actually being used:**

   - Look for console.log "üîç Fetching approved places for category: gastronomy"
   - Check the result log "‚úÖ Query result"

2. **Verify database data:**
   Run in Supabase SQL editor:

   ```sql
   -- Check total approved places
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM thirdparty_places WHERE elvira_approved = true;

   -- Check approved gastronomy places
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM thirdparty_places
   WHERE elvira_approved = true AND category = 'gastronomy';

   -- See actual data
   SELECT id, name, category, elvira_approved
   FROM thirdparty_places
   WHERE elvira_approved = true
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies:**
   Ensure the current user can read approved places:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM thirdparty_places
   WHERE elvira_approved = true
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Refresh the browser to see the new console.log output
2. Check what the query is actually returning
3. Verify the database has the correct data structure
4. Check if RLS policies are blocking the query

## Hook Usage

### For Hotel Views (Approved Only)

```typescript
import { useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces } from "../../../../hooks/third-party-management";

const { data: places, isLoading } = useApprovedThirdPartyPlaces("gastronomy");
// Returns only places where elvira_approved = true
```

### For Elvira Admin (All Places)

```typescript
import { useAllThirdPartyPlaces } from "../../../../hooks/third-party-management/thirdparty-places";

const { data: places } = useAllThirdPartyPlaces({ category: "gastronomy" });
// Returns all places, approved or not
```
